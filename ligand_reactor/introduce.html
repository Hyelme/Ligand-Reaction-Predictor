				<h1>Ligand Reaction Predictor</h1>
				<p>Ligand Reaction Predictor(LRP) is a website that helps the study of the ligand by drewing the predicted response results right away when new ligand emerges. Ligand means a molecule of Antibody / Hormone / Drug, etc. that binds to a receptor. When the body is taken as an example, receptors means to cells in the body,and a substance that reacts when combined with that cell is called ligand. When Ligand combines with a receptor, it generates various reactions. </p>
				<p>The LRP is learned these response results from two learning machines in machine learning. And based on learning information, the predictor is executed to derive the predict response results when a new ligand emerges. The following are how LRP is used and definitions of terms.</p>
				<p id="Subtitle"><br><b>How to use LRP:</b></p>
				<p>1) Select the file containing the SMILES values.<br>
				   2) Select the desired type of learning machine (CNN and DMLP cannot be selected in duplicated.)<br>
				   3) Select the kind of learning method what you want in the selected learning machine.<br>
				   &nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Action types are divided into two types: Agonist and Inhibition.<br>
				   &nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Receptor types are divided into nine categories: catalytic_receptor, enzyme, and gpcr.<br>

				   4) Click the 'Prediction' button.<br>
				   5) After a wait time (approximately 30 seconds), the result is output in the 'Prediction' pane.</p>
				   <p id="Subtitle"><br><b>Difinitions of Terms:</b></p>
				   <p><b>SMILES</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; SMILES(Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is one of the ways of which the structure of chemicals is represented as a character string, like WLN, ROSDAL, etc.<br>
				   <b>Agonist</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; A ligand that binds to a receptor and alters the state of the receptor that causes a biological response.<br>
				   <b>Inhibition</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; Inhibitor means all substances, including antagonist, that have a fundamental deterrent effect.<br>
				   <b>Catalytic Receptor</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; Catalytic receptors are cell-surface proteins, usually dimeric in nature, which encompass ligand binding and functional domains in one polypeptide chain.<br>
				   <b>Enzyme</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; Enzymes are protein catalysts facilitating the conversion of substrates into products.<br>
				   <b>GPCR</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins in the human genome.<br>
				   <b>LGIC</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are integral membrane proteins that contain a pore which allows the regulated flow of selected ions across the plasma membrane.<br>
				   <b>VGIC</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; The voltage-gated ion channels and their structural relatives comprise a superfamily encoded by at least 143 genes in the human genome and are therefore one of the largest superfamilies of signal transduction proteins, following the G protein-coupled receptors and the protein kinases in number.<br>
				   <b>NHR</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; Nuclear receptors are specialised transcription factors with commonalities of sequence and structure, which bind as homo- or heterodimers to specific consensus sequences of DNA (response elements) in the promoter region of particular target genes.<br>
				   <b>Other IC</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; Other than LGIC and VGICs, other ion channels. It belongs that Aquaporins, Chloride channels, Store-operated ion channels to this ion channels. <br>
				   <b>Transporter</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp; Transporters (membrane transport/carrier proteins) are specialized membrane-spanning proteins that assist in the movement of ions, peptides, small molecules, lipids and macromolecules across a biological membrane.<br>
				   <b>Other Protein</b> &nbsp;:&nbsp;  It belongs that Anti-infective targets, Bromodomain-containing proteins, Chaperone proteins, GEFs, etc. to this proteins.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
